# Ionic for JHipster
[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> A JHipster Module that generates an Ionic Client

## Introduction

This is a [JHipster](http://www.jhipster.tech/) module. You can use it to generate an Ionic app that talks to a JHipster backend. It uses the [Ionic JHipster Starter](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/ionic-jhipster-starter) as a base template, then applies functionality (e.g. entity generation) on top of it. 

To learn more about this module, see [Use Ionic for JHipster to Create Mobile Apps with OIDC Authentication](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/01/30/jhipster-ionic-with-oidc-authentication).

## Prerequisites

As this is a [JHipster](http://www.jhipster.tech/) module, we expect you to have an existing JHipster app and Ionic already installed.

- [Installing JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/installation.html)
- [Installing Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/)

Or simply:

```bash
npm i -g generator-jhipster ionic
```

## Installation

To install this module:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-ionic yo
```

To update this module:

```bash
npm update -g generator-jhipster-ionic
```

## Usage

Create a JHipster app using `yo jhipster`, or a backend-only with `yo jhipster:server`. Choose `JWT` or `OAuth 2.0` as the authentication type. 

In a directory alongside your JHipster app, run this module. This will create an Ionic app for you and install the necessary JHipster files for it to communicate with the backend.

```bash
yo jhipster-ionic
```

### Okta for Authentication

Choosing OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for authentication will allow you to use Keycloak or Okta for identity. In theory, you should be able to use any OIDC-compliant identity provider, and these are the only ones we've tested against. JHipster ships with Keycloak configured and ready to go by default. You simply have to start it in your JHipster backend.

```bash
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak up
```

See [JHipster's security docs](https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#-oauth2-and-openid-connect) to see how to configure JHipster for Okta. 

In addition to having a OIDC app for your JHipster backend, you'll need to create a Native app too.

#### Create a Native Application in Okta

Log in to your Okta Developer account (or [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you don't have an account).

From the **Applications** page, choose **Add Application**. On the Create New Application page, select **Native**. Give your app a memorable name, and configure it as follows:
 
* Login redirect URIs: 
  * `http://localhost:8100/implicit/callback`
  * `dev.localhost.ionic:/callback`
* Logout redirect URIs:
  * `http://localhost:8100/implicit/logout`
  * `dev.localhost.ionic:/logout`
  
**NOTE:** `dev.localhost.ionic` is the default scheme, but you can also use something more traditional like `com.okta.dev-737523` (where `dev-737523.okta.com` is your Okta Org URL). If you change it, be sure to update the `URL_SCHEME` in `package.json` and the redirect URIs in `src/app/auth/auth.service.ts`.

```json
"cordova-plugin-customurlscheme": {
    "URL_SCHEME": "com.okta.dev-737523"
},
```

Open `src/app/auth/auth.service.ts` in an editor, search for `data.clientId` and replace it with the client ID from your Native app.

```ts
// try to get the oauth settings from the server
this.requestor.xhr({method: 'GET', url: AUTH_CONFIG_URI}).then(async (data: any) => {
  this.authConfig = {
    identity_client: '{yourClientId}',
    identity_server: data.issuer,
    redirect_url: redirectUri,
    end_session_redirect_url: logoutRedirectUri,
    scopes,
    usePkce: true
  };
  ...
}
```

#### Add Claims to Access Token

In order to authentication successfully with your Ionic app, you have to do a bit more configuration in Okta. Since the Ionic client will only send an access token to JHipster, you need to 1) add a `groups` claim to the access token and 2) add a couple more claims so the user's name will be available in JHipster.

Navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers**, click the **Authorization Servers** tab and edit the **default** one. Click the **Claims** tab and **Add Claim**. Name it "groups" and include it in the Access Token. Set the value type to "Groups" and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`. Click **Create**.

Add another claim, name it `given_name`, include it in the access token, use `Expression` in the value type, and set the value to `user.firstName`. Optionally, include it in the `profile` scope. Perform the same actions to create a `family_name` claim and use expression `user.lastName`.

### iOS 

Generate a native project with the following command:

```
ionic cordova prepare ios
```

Open your project in Xcode, configure code signing, and run your app.

```
open platforms/ios/MyApp.xcworkspace
```

### Android

Generate a native project with the following command:

```
ionic cordova prepare android
```

Set the launchMode to `singleTask` so the URL does not trigger a new instance of the app in `platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<activity
      android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale"
      android:name="com.mydomain.app.MainActivity"
      android:label="@string/title_activity_main"
      android:launchMode="singleTask"
      android:theme="@style/AppTheme.NoActionBarLaunch">
```

Open your project in Android Studio and run your app.

```
studio platforms/android
```

You'll need to run a couple commands to allow the emulator to communicate with your API and Keycloak.

```
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
adb reverse tcp:9080 tcp:9080
```

### Entity Generator

To generate entities, run `yo jhipster-ionic:entity <name>`.

## Testing

You can run unit tests with:

```
npm test
```

See the [testing section](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/ionic-jhipster-starter#testing) of the Ionic JHipster Starter for more information.
