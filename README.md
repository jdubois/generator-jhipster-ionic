# Ionic for JHipster
[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> A JHipster Module that generates an Ionic Client

# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](http://www.jhipster.tech/) module. You can use it to generate an Ionic app that talks to a JHipster backend. It uses the [Ionic JHipster Starter](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/ionic-jhipster-starter) as a base template, then applies functionality (e.g. entity generation) on top of it. 

To learn more about this module, see [Use Ionic for JHipster to Create Mobile Apps with OIDC Authentication](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/01/30/jhipster-ionic-with-oidc-authentication).

# Prerequisites

As this is a [JHipster](http://www.jhipster.tech/) module, we expect you to have an existing JHipster app and Ionic already installed.

- [Installing JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/installation.html)
- [Installing Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/)

Or simply:

```bash
npm i -g generator-jhipster ionic
```

# Installation

To install this module:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-ionic
```

To update this module:

```bash
npm update -g generator-jhipster-ionic
```

# Usage

Create a JHipster app using `yo jhipster`, or a backend-only with `yo jhipster:server`. Choose `JWT` or `OAuth 2.0` as the authentication type. 

In a directory alongside your JHipster app, run this module. This will create an Ionic app for you and install the necessary JHipster files for it to communicate with the backend.

```bash
yo jhipster-ionic
```

# Entity Generator

To generate entities, run `yo jhipster-ionic:entity <name>`.

# Testing

You can run unit tests with:

```
npm test
```

And e2e tests with:

```
npm run build --prod && npm run e2e
```

See the [testing section](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/ionic-jhipster-starter#testing) of the Ionic JHipster Starter for more information.
